## Contributing

We love to receive contributions from the community and hear your opinions! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

### Developing

If you want to contribute, here's how to set up `project_name` for local development:

1. Fork the `project_name` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/project_name.git`
3. Install the project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create a branch for your own fixes: `git checkout -b fix/some-bug`
5. Make your changes and ensure any new code has appropriate tests.
6. Run the tests and ensure they pass: `make test`
7. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."`
8. Push your branch to GitHub: `git push origin fix/some-bug`
9. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Code of Conduct

We expect everyone to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a welcoming and respectful environment for all contributors.
