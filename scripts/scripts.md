To use these shell scripts:

1. Save each script to a `.sh` file with the appropriate name (e.g., `check_logs.sh`).
2. Make each script executable using the command `chmod +x script_name.sh`.
3. Run the script using `./script_name.sh`.

Remember to replace the placeholder commands in each script with the actual commands you want to run. The provided examples are just for illustration.
